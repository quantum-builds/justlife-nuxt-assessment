## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/quantum-builds/justlife-nuxt-assessment
cd justlife-nuxt-assessment
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Use npm or yarn to install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Set up environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your `NEWS_API_KEY`. You can get an API key by signing up on [News API](https://newsapi.org/).

```env
NEWS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Make sure to replace `your_api_key_here` with the actual API key.

### 4. Run the project

Once everything is set up, you can start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Your Nuxt 3 app will be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
